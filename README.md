A hands-on lab to help people understand how to install and support the newest way of deploying Linux systems

# Welcome ! 
This repository is a hands-on lab exercise for anyone wanting to get to understand better how to build, deploy, and update the new bootc image mode deployments

# Requirements: 
You'll need two physical or virtual machines - one to build the container/kickstart/etc on and the second to install your image onto. 
You'll also need a Red Hat Developer account and access to Quay.io to host your container's registry.
